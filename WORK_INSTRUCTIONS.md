## Image Handling

#### Image File Paths
- **You only need to enter the filename** (e.g., `photo.jpg`)
- The system automatically constructs the full URL using:
  - Base URL: `https://www.bloodcenter.org/webres/Image/FGN/`
  - Date folder: `MMDDYYYY/` (from publication date)
  - Filename: Your entered filename
- **Example**: If date is `2025-10-24` and you enter `photo.jpg`, the full URL becomes:
  `https://www.bloodcenter.org/webres/Image/FGN/10242025/photo.jpg`

#### Single Image vs. Gallery
- **1 image** = Displays as a single static photo (no slideshow)
- **2+ images** = Displays as an interactive gallery/slideshow with navigation controls
- The system automatically detects which format to use based on the number of images

#### Gallery Navigation Features
- **Left/Right Arrows**: Click the arrow buttons to manually navigate through gallery images
- **Auto-Play**: Images automatically advance every 5 seconds
- **Hover to Pause**: Hover your mouse over a gallery image to pause the automatic slideshow
- **Manual Navigation**: Clicking arrows restarts the auto-play timer
- Arrows become more visible when hovering over the gallery

#### Image Captions/Descriptions
- Click the **"+"** button next to any image field to add a caption
- The button changes to **"−"** when the caption field is active
- **Captions serve dual purpose**:
  - Display as visible text underneath the image
  - Automatically function as alt text for accessibility
- **For single images**: Caption displays statically below the image
- **For galleries**: Each image can have its own caption that updates as you navigate
- If you add captions, the separate "Image Alt Text" field becomes optional
- Click **"−"** to hide the caption field (caption text will be cleared)

#### Bulk File Upload
1. Click **"📁 Upload Files"** in the Images section of any article
2. Select multiple image files from your computer
3. The system will:
   - Extract all filenames
   - Construct full URLs automatically
   - Add them to the gallery list
4. You can then edit individual filenames or add captions as needed

### Rich Text Editor
- **Bold** (B), *Italic* (I), Underline (U)
- Bullet lists and numbered lists
- Links (chain icon)
- Text alignment options
- **Pasting Content**: You can paste formatted content from Word, Google Docs, etc.
  - The tool automatically strips inline styles and CSS when pasting
  - This ensures your content uses the template's styling, not external styles
  - Only semantic formatting (bold, italic, lists, links) is preserved

### Video Embeds
- Paste a standard YouTube or Vimeo URL
- Examples:
  - `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
  - `https://vimeo.com/VIDEO_ID`
- The system converts it to an embed format automatically

### Reordering Articles
- Click and hold the drag handle (⋮⋮) in the article header
- Drag the article up or down to reorder
- The preview updates automatically
- The order in the form matches the order in the final output

## Tips

### Image Alt Text & Captions
- **Always provide alt text or captions** for images (required by the system)
- **Two ways to provide alt text**:
  1. **Use Image Captions** (Recommended): Click the "+" button next to an image field and add a caption
     - Captions automatically function as both visible text AND alt text
     - One entry serves both purposes - more efficient!
  2. **Use Image Alt Text Field**: Fill in the separate "Image Alt Text" field
     - Required if you don't add captions
     - Optional if you've added captions to your images
- **Best Practice**: Use captions when you want visible text under images, use alt text field when you only need accessibility text
- Describe what's in the image, not just "photo" or "image"
- Think: "If I described this image to someone over the phone, what would I say?"
- Example: "Group of volunteers smiling at a blood drive event" (not just "volunteers")

### Article Titles
- Keep titles concise but descriptive
- The title appears in the article header and updates automatically
- If left blank, defaults to "Article X"

### "In the News" Section
- **Automatic Metadata Fetching**: The system attempts to fetch article titles and images automatically
- **CORS Limitations**: Some websites block cross-origin requests, so auto-fetch may not work for all URLs
- **Manual Entry**: If auto-fetch fails, you can manually enter the title and image URL
- **Using Social Share Preview**: Visit [socialsharepreview.com](https://socialsharepreview.com) and paste your article URL to see the title and image, then copy them into the form
- **Multiple Stories**: Add as many news articles as needed - they'll display in a navigable gallery
- **Gallery Features**: 
  - Navigation arrows appear when there are 2+ stories
  - Indicator bubbles show the total number of stories
  - Auto-play cycles through stories every 5 seconds
  - Hover over the gallery to pause auto-play
- **Positioning**: The section appears before "Thank the Donor" and "Employee Spotlight" in the final output

### Employee Spotlight
- All default questions can be edited or removed
- Add custom questions as needed for special features
- The image defaults to a placeholder - remember to update it!
- **Image Upload**: Use the "📁 Upload File" button to easily upload employee photos
  - The system automatically uses the publication date to place files in the correct folder
  - Just like article images, employee spotlight images go in: `https://www.bloodcenter.org/webres/Image/FGN/MMDDYYYY/`

### Preview Pane
- Use the preview to catch formatting issues early
- The preview updates in real-time (300ms delay)
- Scroll position is maintained while typing (no auto-scroll to top)

### File Organization
- Images should be uploaded to: `https://www.bloodcenter.org/webres/Image/FGN/MMDDYYYY/`
- Use the publication date format: `MMDDYYYY` (e.g., `10242025` for October 24, 2025)
- Filenames should be descriptive but not too long

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Please set a publication date" Warning
- **Solution**: Select a date in the "Publication Date" field at the top
- You cannot add articles until a date is set

### Images Not Displaying
- **Check**: Did you enter just the filename (not the full URL)?
- **Check**: Is the publication date set correctly?
- **Check**: Are the image files actually uploaded to the server at the expected path?
- **Check**: Image alt text OR captions are required - make sure at least one is provided
  - You can use the "+" button to add captions (which also function as alt text)
  - Or fill in the "Image Alt Text" field

### Gallery Not Working
- **Check**: Do you have 2 or more images? (1 image = no gallery)
- **Check**: Are all image URLs valid?
- **Check**: Preview the output in a browser to see if JavaScript errors appear
- **Gallery Navigation**:
  - Arrows should appear on the left and right sides of gallery images
  - Hover over the gallery to see arrows more clearly
  - Click arrows to manually navigate
  - Hover over the gallery to pause auto-play

### Can't Add Articles
- **Check**: Is the publication date set?
- **Check**: Are there any JavaScript errors in the browser console?
- **Solution**: Refresh the page and try again

### Import Not Working
- **Check**: Did you paste the complete HTML (including `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags)?
- **Check**: Is the HTML from a previous version of this tool?
- **Solution**: Try copying the HTML again, ensuring you get the complete code

### Page Scrolling to Top While Typing
- This should be fixed, but if it happens:
- **Solution**: The system should maintain scroll position automatically
- If issues persist, try refreshing the page

### Article Order Not Updating
- **Check**: Did you drag the article using the handle (⋮⋮)?
- **Check**: The preview should update automatically
- **Solution**: Try dragging again or refresh the page
